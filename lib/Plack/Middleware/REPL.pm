=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware::REPL - REPL when your application throws errors or warnings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  enable "REPL";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Middleware::REPL is a PSGI middleware component that enables
REPL (read-eval-print-loop) when your application raises errors.

  # your Dancer app
  use Dancer;
  get '/' => sub {
      my $n = parms()->{name}; # typo
      return "Hi there $n";
  };
  dance;

Run it with the REPL middleware:

  plackup -e 'enable "REPL"' app.pl

Hit your application, and you'll get a REPL shell on the console:

  File /Users/miyagawa/development/dancer/app.pl
    5: use Dancer;
    6:
    7: get '/' => sub {
  * 8:     my $n = parms()->{name};
    9:     return "Hi there $n";
   10: };
   11: dance;

  $ $self
  $Dancer_Route1 = Dancer::Route=HASH(0x10089d278);

You can also directly call L<Carp::REPL>'s C<repl> function anywhere
in your application, to start a REPL shell without dying.

See L<Carp::REPL> for more commands in the REPL shell.

=item warn

  enable "REPL", warn => 1;

Also enables REPL when your app throws warnings.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Because of the way C<< $SIG{__DIE__} >> works in Perl, this middleware
doesn't work well with web application frameworks that sets its own
exception handler, such as L<Mojolicious>. For such cases, you can
enabel the REPL shell by calling the C<repl> function in your
application (described above).
