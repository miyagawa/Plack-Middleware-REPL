NAME
    Plack::Middleware::REPL - REPL when your application throws errors or
    warnings

SYNOPSIS
      enable "REPL";

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::REPL is a PSGI middleware component that enables REPL
    (read-eval-print-loop) when your application raises errors.

      # your Dancer app
      use Dancer;
      get '/' => sub {
          my $self = shift;
          my $n = parms()->{name}; # typo
          return "Hi there $n";
      };
      dance;

    Run it with the REPL middleware:

      plackup -e 'enable "REPL"' app.pl

    Hit your application, and you'll get a REPL shell on the console:

      Trace begun at ...
      ...
      $ :l
      File /Users/miyagawa/development/dancer/app.pl
        5: use Dancer;
        6:
        7: get '/' => sub {
        8:     my $self = shift;
      * 9:     my $n = parms()->{name};
       10:     return "Hi there $n";
       11: };
       12: dance;
      $ request->path
      /
      $ :u
      Now at /Users/miyagawa/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.12.3/lib/site_perl/5.12.3/Dancer/Route.pm:246 (frame 1).
      $ $self
      $Dancer_Route1 = Dancer::Route=HASH(0x10089d278);

    See Carp::REPL for more commands in the REPL shell.

OPTIONS
    warn
          enable "REPL", warn => 1;

        Also enables REPL when your app throws warnings.

LIMITATIONS
    Because of the way $SIG{__DIE__} works in Perl, this middleware doesn't
    work well with web application frameworks that sets its own exception
    handler, such as Mojolicious.
